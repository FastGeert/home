# Grid Development Setup

The setup consists of three elements:

- [Setup AYS Server](#setup-ays)
- [Create the G8OS nodes](#create-nodes)
- [Setup the Grid API Server](#grid-api)

## Setup the AYS Server

* Install JumpScale:

  ```shell
  cd $TMPDIR
  rm -f install.sh
  export JSBRANCH="8.2.0"
  curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jumpscale/jumpscale_core8/$JSBRANCH/install/install.sh?$RANDOM > install.sh
  bash install.sh
  ```

* Install g8core Python client:

  This is the client the AYS uses to communicate to core0.

  ```shell
  pip3 install g8core
  ```

* Create the AYS repository:

  This is the repository that will contain any blueprints executed by the API or executed manually for our grid setup.

  ```shell
  ays repo create --name objstor --git http://github.com/user/repo
  ```

* Clone the AYS templates:

 This repo contains a dir templates which includes all the schemas and actions for our ays services.

  ```shell
  cd /opt/code/
  git clone https://github.com/g8os/grid/
  cd grid
  git checkout 1.1.0-alpha
  ays reload
  ```

* Install auto node discovery service:

  Add the following blueprint in any file under the blueprints dir of your ays repo.
  This blueprint will install the auto discovery service which will auto discover all the core0 nodes.

  ```
  bootstrap.g8os__grid1:

  actions:
    - action: install
  ```

  If your setup doesn't allow auto discovery for any reason (e.g. js is in a container and the core0 is running on localhost), you can manually add the core0 node in the blueprint:

  ```
  node.g8os__525400123456:
    redisAddr: 172.17.0.1


  actions:
   - action: install
  ```

  Where 525400123456 is mac address of the core0 node with the ':' removed and the redisAddr is the ip of the node.

  After creating either blueprints, run the following commands to execute the blueprints:

  ```shell
  ays blueprint
  ays run create --follow
  ```

## Create the G8OS nodes

* Start a G8OS Core0 node:

  For that you'll need to have the kernel compiled, see: https://github.com/g8os/initramfs

  Example how to start a VM running G8OS using qemu:

  ```bash
  qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel g8os-kernel.efi \
     -m 2048 -enable-kvm -cpu host \
     -net nic,model=e1000 -net bridge,br=lxc0 \
     -drive file=vda.qcow2,if=virtio \
     -drive file=vdb.qcow2,if=virtio \
     -drive file=vdc.qcow2,if=virtio \
     -drive file=vdd.qcow2,if=virtio \
     -drive file=vde.qcow2,if=virtio \
     -nodefaults -nographic \
     -serial null -serial mon:stdio \
     -append 'ays=localhost:5000'
  ```

  This command start the VM with 5 disk attached to it.

  Note the `-append` where we specify the address of the AYS server. This is used for auto discovery of the node when they boot.

  Once your G8OS is booted, you should have the `node.g8os` services created.

## Setup the Grid API Server

* Build the API:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/g8os/grid
  cd grid/api
  git checkout 1.1.0-alpha
  go build
  ```

* Run the API:

  `./api --bind :8080 --ays-url http://aysserver.com:5000 --ays-repo objstor`

  - `--bind :8080` makes the server listen on all interfaces on port 8080
  - `--ays-url` need to point to the AYS REST API
  - `--ays-repo` is the name of the AYS repository the Grid API need to use. It should be the repo you created in step 1.
