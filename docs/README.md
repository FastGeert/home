# Introduction to G8OS

G8OS is a stateless and lightweight Linux operating system designed for clustered deployments to host virtual machines and containerized applications.

- G8OS is stateless by not needing any locally stored data, not even G8OS system files
- G8OS is lightweight by only containing the components required to securely run and manage containers and virtual machines

See [ Getting Started with G8OS](gettingstarted/gettingstarted.md) for the recommended path to quickly get up and running with G8OS.

Key components:

- [0-Initramfs Builder](#0-initramfs)
- [0-Core](#0-core)

## 0-Initramfs Builder

0-Initramfs Builder is an assembly of shell scripts for building the G8OS Linux kernel and create an 0-initramfs to start 0-Core.

<a id="0-core"></a>
## 0-Core

0-Core is the G8OS replacement for systemd, the init system to bootstrap the user space and manage all processes subsequently.

Interacting with 0-Core is done by sending commands through a Redis, allowing you to manage disks, set-up networks and create containers and start virtual machines.

<a id="0-fs"></a>
##

 is the G8OS file system used in containers, which is actually a FUSE file system. Mounting the  is done by using a flist, which is a relatively small RocksDB database file, containing the metadata of the actual files and directories. On accessing a file G8OS fetches the required file chunks from a remote store, and caches it locally. This remote store is the G8OS Hub, discussed here below.

<a id="hub"></a>
## Hub

The G8OS Hub is where all container images and and vdisk boot images are stored.

<a id="resourcepool"></a>
## Rest API

A resource pool is a cluster of G8OS nodes, sharing compute and storage capacity.

<a id="blockstorage"></a>
## Block Storage

G8OS Block Storage is about the components that allow to create and use block devices (vdisks) from within virtual machines hosted on a G8OS node.
