# Releases
 - [v0.9.0](https://github.com/g8os/core0/releases/tag/v0.9.0) : First usable beta version of the G8OS.

# Milestones
- [0.10.0](https://github.com/g8os/home/milestone/4) :
  - revert usage of IPFS as storage system for flist file.  
    After our tests in 0.9.0 to use IPFS as storage, it turns out that it doesn't fit our need for big Flist. This version revert the usage of IPFS to our own Store.

- [0.11.0](https://github.com/g8os/home/milestone/5) :
  - monitoring / statistics
  - self update
  - container persistance ( maybe using AYS )
  - investigate how to integrate ipfs lib inside core


- [1.0](https://github.com/g8os/home/milestone/2) :
  - First stable version and freezing of the APIs. Backward compatibility contracts start from this version.
